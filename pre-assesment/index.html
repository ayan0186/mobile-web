    <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!--Hey Thomas!-->
    <img src="img/content-image2.jpg" alt="content image">
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
    <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
    <p>When an image can't be loaded, the browser will display the alt text in its place so the user can get an idea of why the image was included. The title attribute, on the other hand, provides additional information about an image. This information is displayed as a tooltip when a user hovers over the image.</p>
    <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
    
      <dl>
        <dt>Machine</dt>
        <dd>an apparatus consisting of interrelated parts with separate functions, used in the performance of some kind of work</dd>
        <dt>antidisestablishmentarianism</dt>
        <dd>opposition to the withdrawal of state support or recognition from an established church, especially the Anglican Church in 19th-century England.</dd>
    </dl>
  
  <h4>Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site &amp; create a style rule to change the background color of the link when the user hovers over it. </h4>
